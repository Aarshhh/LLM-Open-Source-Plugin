# LLM-Open-Source-Plugin
ChatGPT being the benchmark for the most advanced LLM, automating the tasks on third party applications including Canva, Youtube, Expedia, Kayak by developing a plugins to communicate with external applications. These plugins serve to utilize the third party applications and generate presentations or any other task based on the user prompt. However, there remains a gap in existence of external plugins built on top of open-source LLM models introduced by microsoft, google, and other organizations. 
This project aids to bridge this gap by introducing two plugins - 1. Youtube Video Summarizer
2. AIPDF for extracting the content from youtube video or pdf and summarzing the content, generating questions and answers related to the content or answering to the questions asked by the user based on the content.
