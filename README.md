# External Plugins for Open-Source LLM Models

This project introduces two innovative plugins designed to enhance the capabilities of open-source large language models (LLMs) by automating tasks on third-party platforms like YouTube and PDF documents. While tools such as ChatGPT provide advanced plugins for various applications, there remains a gap for similar solutions in the open-source LLM space. This repository bridges that gap by utilizing LLama 3 and Orca Model to develop two plugins:-

1. YouTube Video Summarizer Plugin
Summarizes the content of YouTube videos, generates key questions and answers, and provides insights or answers queries based on the video content.

2. AIPDF Plugin
Extracts content from PDF documents, offering summarization, question generation, and the ability to answer user questions directly from the extracted text.

These plugins allow seamless content extraction and interaction, opening up the potential for enhanced productivity and automation in a variety of tasks.
